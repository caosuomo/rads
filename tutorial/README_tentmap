Procedure for running test_tent.py:
-----------------------------------

1. From the command line in Canopy, type 'run test_tent.py', or open
'test_tent.py' and click the green arrow. A few messages will print --
eg., the subdivision depth and the size of the invariant set as the
resolution is increased (up to the <depth> variable, first line below imports).

2. Next, a plot of the graph of the outer enclosure will pop up. 

   -- Note, the indexing is 0-based, so if you divide [0,1] into
      subintervals, these will correspond to nodes {0,1,2,3}.

3. You can explore the tree using 'ce.tree.boxes'. Make sure its
structure makes sense. The outer approximation (called a Multivalued
Map, or MVM) is stored in ce.mvm. By pressing <tab> in the terminal
after 'ce.mvm.' will get you a list of attributes. This works for any
Python object (super handy!).
