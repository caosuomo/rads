def blockmodel(G,partitions,multigraph=False):

    Returns a reduced graph constructed using the generalized block
    modeling technique.

    The blockmodel technique collapses nodes into blocks based on a
    given partitioning of the node set.  Each partition of nodes
    (block) is represented as a single node in the reduced graph.

    Edges between nodes in the block graph are added according to the
    edges in the original graph.  If the parameter multigraph is False
    (the default) a single edge is added with a weight equal to the
    sum of the edge weights between nodes in the original graph The
    default is a weight of 1 if weights are not specified.  If the
    parameter multigraph is True then multiple edges are added each
    with the edge data from the original graph.

    Parameters
    ----------
    G : graph
        A networkx Graph or DiGraph
    partitions : list of lists, or list of sets 
        The partition of the nodes.  Must be non-overlapping.
    multigraph : bool, optional
        If True return a MultiGraph with the edge data of the original
        graph applied to each corresponding edge in the new graph.  If
        False return a Graph with the sum of the edge weights, or a
        count of the edges if the original graph is unweighted.

    Returns
    -------
    blockmodel : (a Networkx graph object) -> JJB -- a digraph.Digraph object
    
    Examples
    --------
    >>> G=nx.path_graph(6)
