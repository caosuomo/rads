Running and experimenting with test_tent.py

Building the tent map code:
---------------------------



Procedure for running test_tent.py:
-----------------------------------

1. From the command line in Canopy, type 'run test_tent.py', or open
'test_tent.py' and click the green arrow. A few messages will print --
eg., the subdivision depth and the size of the invariant set as the
resolution is increased (up to the <depth> variable, first line below imports).

2. Next, a plot of the graph of the outer enclosure will pop up. 

   -- Note, the indexing is 0-based, so if you divide [0,1] into
      subintervals, these will correspond to nodes {0,1,2,3}.

3. You can explore the tree using 'ce.tree.boxes', the outer enclosure
(called a Multivalued Map, or MVM) using ce.mvm.*. Pressing <tab> will
get you a list of attributes of ce.mvm.

4. Of special note(!): I'm not sure the MVM is right. I need to ask
Raf (the author of this part of the code) about this. Claire, you're
the expert. Test it out using a depth of 1,2, or 3.

    -- Self-loops won't plot (yet). But you'll see them printed to the
       screen, so as we're testing hypotheses we can use this to
       confirm.

    -- ce.mvm.graph is a normal NetworkX DiGraph object so you can use
       anything in NetworkX on it. (The MVM is just a "wrapper" around
       it.)
