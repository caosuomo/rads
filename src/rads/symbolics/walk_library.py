Contains classes and functions for dealing with storing and handling a set of
walks through a graph where matricies are associated with each edge.

Summary:
-------

We work with a finite alphabet, A = {1,...,m}, which are the nodes of
the constructed graph. Allowable transitions i -> j, determined from
the underlying dynamics, define the edges, E. We can think of each
edge as colored. The coloring function associates to each edge e \in E
a color in B = {1,...,k},

c : E --> B.

The graph G is the triple < G, E, c >. In this way we create a
subshift of a colored graph, defined by

X_G = { (x_i)_{i \in N} : \forall n \in N, \exists path a \subset E
such that the coloring c(a) = [x] is allowable },

where c(a) = [x] refers to the coloring of the path (i.e. the matrix
product). We are constructing X_G based on a search for all [x].
