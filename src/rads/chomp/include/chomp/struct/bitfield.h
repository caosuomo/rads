/// This file contains the definition of a bitfield class which works
/// an array of bits. The functionality of this class is very limited
/// and it is optimized for the specific application in the homology
/// computation algorithms.
///
/// Note that memory allocation and deallocation,
/// as well as remembering the length of the bitfield is the responsibility
/// of the code which uses the bitfield, the class bitfield doesn't take
/// care of these issues.
