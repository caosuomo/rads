# Usage: Put this makefile in the directory containing your own source code
# which uses the CHomP library. Then add your source files names in the
# PROGS and OTHERS variables below as space-separated lists.

# Use "make" on its own to make all of your programs or "make spec" to make
# a specific program or sub-package only.
# Note: The CHomP library must already exist and be compiled.


# ===========================================================================
# Programs which can be compiled using this makefile.
# ===========================================================================

# a list of all the programs in your package
PROGS = cubtop

# a list of all your units to be linked with your programs
OTHERS = avlnode avltree pptextfile ptkbitmap ptkelementarycell ptkrepresentableset

# the CHomP library or libraries to use (if different from the global one)
LIBRARY =

# define "GUI = 0" for console applications, otherwise GUI is assumed
GUI = 0

# a subdirectory for storing the object files of this program group
SUBDIR = cubtop


# ===========================================================================
# Include the generic makefile for this project.
