CHomP Programs
</H1>

<p>There are numerous programs included in the advanced version of the
Homology Package. All of them are command-line driven utilities that can be
launched from the text terminal by typing a suitable command. Moreover, all
these programs run in the text mode, except for <em>showcubes</em>.</p>

<P>The programs that are contained in the Homology Package are described
in short below. Moreover, each program displays a brief message on its
purpose and usage if called without arguments.
The <A HREF="textdata.html">text&nbsp;data&nbsp;format</A> page explains how
to understand the format of the input/output files used by the programs.
Also, several <a href="examples.html">examples</a> are included in the
Homology Package. They can be helpful in understanding how to use the
programs.</p>

<p>It is recommended that one downloads the source code of the programs and
compiles them oneslef; nevertheless, the executable programs already
compiled for some popular systems (including Windows and Linux) are also
available for download in the <em>Download</em> section
of the CHomP website.</P>

<HR>

<H2>Common command-line arguments</H2>

<P>Most programs in the package support the following common
command-line arguments:</P>

<UL>
<LI> --help - displays brief information on the purpose of the program
and its command-line syntax (also if invoked with no arguments)
<LI> --quiet - suppresses output to the screen (makes the program run quietly)
<LI> --log filename - saves all the output except for progress indicators
to the given file
</UL>

<P><B>cnvmvmap</B> - converts a combinatorial cubical multivalued map
