CHomP Software Chooser
</H1>


<p><b>Description.</b> The CHomP Software Chooser
is a cute GUI Python script which contains detailed information
on the command line of each program and helps configure each program
in an interactive way.</p>

<p><b>System requirements.</b> A Python interpreter (with Tkinter)
is necessary to run this program. It is preinstalled on most Unix/Linux
systems and in MacOS; in some cases, however, it might be necessary to
install some additional packages - see your system's manual for details.
For MS Windows users, a freely downloadable distribution known as
<a href="http://www.activestate.com/Products/activepython/"
target="_top">Active&nbsp;Python</a> is recommended.</p>

<p><b>Directions.</b> To make the best use of the script, open a terminal
window (or command prompt) and run the script
with the command <tt>python&nbsp;chooser.py</tt>.
Hover your mouse pointer over various areas in the script window,
and reed the descriptions that appear at the bottom of the screen.
Select a program from the list on the left, and its command-line
arguments will be displayed as a form to the right of the programs' list.
While filling in the form, the program's command line is automatically
updated in a window below. Click the RUN button to run the program
with the selected arguments. The output of the program is displayed in the
terminal window from which the script was started.
Hit the ESC key or close the window to exit the program.</p>

<p><b>Location.</b> The CHomP Software Chooser Python script
is located in the <tt>python</tt> subdirectory
of the source code package. The name of the script
is <tt>chooser.py</tt>.</p>

<p><b>Sample screenshot.</b> This is a screenshot which illustrates what
the CHomP Software Chooser looks like (in your operating system it may look
slightly different). You are welcome to run the program yourself
to explore all its featuers.</p>
