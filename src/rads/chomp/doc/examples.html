CHomP Examples
</H1>

<p>Several examples on how to use the Homology Programs are gathered
in the <em>examples/</em> subdirectory of the source code package
of the advanced version of the Homology Software.
Each example consists of a text file with brief explanation,
a script file that displays this information and runs the computations,
and a few additional files.
A relatively up-to-date list of these examples is given below,
with brief explanation what they illustrate
(browse the <em>exemples/</em> subdirectory of CHomP
or run the script <em>python/examples.py</em> for an up-to-date list).
To run each of the examples, type the command listed in the left column
of the table below (add the extension ".bat" in Windows
or ".sh" in Linux/MacOS/Unix). Note that in some systems it may be necessary
to precede the command with "./", that is, for example,
type <tt>./bing.sh</tt> to run the example named <em>bing</em> below.</p>

<tr><td align="center"><b>NAME</b></td>
<td align="center"><b>DESCRIPTION</b></td></tr>

<tr><td>bing</td><td>
Bing's house with two rooms is an example of a contractible cubical set,
built of squares embedded in <b>R</b><sup>3</sup>,
which cannot be reduced by means of free face collapses.
This example shows how to define a general cubical set
in which each cube is a Cartesian product of intervals.
It also shows how to compute homology of such a set
using the program <em>homcubes</em>.
</td></tr>

<tr><td>circle</td><td>
In this example a map of a circle onto itself with double winding 
is defined. The map in homology thus maps the 1-dimensional generator 
onto itself with the coefficient of 2. The map is given as a cubical 
multivalued map. This example shows how to use the old program
<em>chmap</em> to compute the homomorphism induced by such a map in homology,
and also how easy it is to do the same using the new features
of the program <em>homcubes</em>.
</td></tr>

<tr><td>circthin</td><td>
This is a modification of the "circle" example, described above.
The map is given as a multivalued map defined on cubical cells
of dimension lower than the space dimension.
This example shows how to use the program <em>homcelmp</em>.
</td></tr>

<tr><td>dim10</td><td>
In this example the homology module of a 10-dimensional cube in R^10 
is computed. It is a simple example which shows how to use
the <em>homcubes</em> program. It also illustrates how difficult
computations in high dimensions can be.
</td></tr>

<tr><td>excision</td><td>
This is an example of an index pair (for a discrete dynamical system)
which does not satisfy the excision property, as explained in the paper
"Excision-preserving Cubical Approach to the Algorithmic Computation
of the Discrete Conley Index" by K. Stolot and P. Pilarczyk.
Instead of using the <em>homcubes</em> program, one must do the
computations using the new program <em>homcub2l</em> to overcome
the difficulty.
</td></tr>

<tr><td>incl</td><td>
This is an example which shows how to compute the homomorphism
induced in relative homology by a continuous map on a pair of cubical sets.
It also illustrates a potential problem that may occur if one uses
the <em>-i</em> switch of the <em>homcubes</em> program.
</td></tr>

<tr><td>kleinbot</td><td>
In this example, the homology module of the Klein bottle
is computed with coefficients in Z and in Z_2.
The homology module is computed by the program <em>homcubes</em>. We first 
compute the homology module with integer coefficients, and then with 
coefficients in <b>Z</b><sub>2</sub>.
This example contains two pictures of the Klein bottle. One consists 
of 4-dimensional cubes which was created with the use of a parametrization
for embedding of this manifold into R^4. The other one consists of
2-dimensional elementary cubes (cubical cells) in R^4 and was obtained
from the first one by geometric reduction programmed in <em>homcubes</em>.
</td></tr>

<tr><td>maze</td><td>
In this example the homology of a closed maze stored in a bitmap file 
is computed. The external wall forms the circle in which the maze is
contained. If the maze picture has the homology of the circle, 
then this means that all the internal walls can be homotopically 
contracted towards the external wall and, as a consequence, from 
every place inside the maze to every other place there exists 
a path between the walls and this path is unique.
This example shows how to convert BMP files to a text list of squares,
and then how to compute the homology of this set of 2-dimensional cubes.
</td></tr>

<tr><td>nonacycl</td><td>
This is an example of an acyclic cubical multivalued map F: X -> Y such that
its restriction to the subset A of X is not acyclic. Therefore, the map
induced by F: (X, A) -> (Y, B) cannot be computed by "homcubes".
This example illustrates how to use the program <em>chkmvmap</em>
which verifies whether a cubical map satisfies the necessary assumptions
for the homology computation.
</td></tr>

<tr><td>nonred</td><td>
This is an example of two geometric figures which are unions of cubes 
which are difficult to reduce, although they are acyclic, that is, their 
homology is the homology of a one-point space.
This is a small example that illustrates how to use the <em>homcubes</em>
program for the computation of homology of full cubical sets.
</td></tr>

<tr><td>num</td><td>
This is a technical example that illustrates how to use
a compact representation of cubical sets and maps.
</td></tr>

<tr><td>probl</td><td>
This is a real example of a map which seems to be good for homology
computation, but the program <em>homcubes</em> reduces the cubes in such a way
that after the reduction the map is no longer acyclic. This example shows
how to turn on the careful reduction method which does preserve the acyclicity
of the map (this is done by the <em>-a</em> switch) to get
the right result.</td></tr>

<tr><td>projplan</td><td>
In this example the homology module over <b>Z</b>
and over <b>Z</b><sub>2</sub> of the projective 
plane is computed.
This example shows how to use the <em>homchain</em> program
to compute homology over <b>Z</b> and over <b>Z</b><sub>2</sub>.
It also shows an embedding of a simplicial complex into the boundary
of a high-dimensional hypercube; a PDF file with detailed explanation
was prepared by Navin Sivakumar.
</td></tr>

<tr><td>qexample</td><td>
This is a series of examples of simplicial complexes represented in terms
of faces of an n-dimensional cube in <b>R</b><sup><em>n</em></sup>.
These examples were prepared by Anik Trahan, and they include
the Klein bottle, M&ouml;bius band, real projective plane and torus.
The elementary cubes are defined as Cartesian products of intervals,
and the homology computation is done by the <em>homcubes</em> program.
</td></tr>

<tr><td>relative</td><td>
In this example, relative homology of a pair of sets (X, Y) painted in 
a BMP file is computed. The set Y consists of black pixels, and the set 
X\Y is painted in grey.
This example shows how to use the program <em>bmp2pset</em> which extracts
pixels from BMP images, and how to compute relative homology
with <em>homcubes</em>.
</td></tr>

<tr><td>repeller</td><td>
This example illustrates how to compute the discrete Conley index of a 
repelling fixed point in <b>R</b>.
It is an illustration of how to use the program <em>cnvmvmap</em>
to convert between different formats of cubical maps,
how to run the program <em>indxpair</em> which constructs
an index pair, and then how to compute the Conley index
of this index pair with the <em>homcubes</em> program.
</td></tr>

<tr><td>simklein<br/>simproj2<br/>simtorus</td><td>
This is a series of examples in which various simplicial complexes
are defined, and their homology is computed.
In the first step, a chain complex is created from the list of simplices 
of the highest dimension by the program <em>simchain</em>.
Then the homology of  this chain complex
is computed by the program <em>homchain</em>,
either with coefficients in the ring <b>Z</b>,
or in some field <b>Z</b><sub><em>p</em></sub>.
The usage of the program <em>homsimpl</em> is also illustrated.
This program can perform both steps
of the computations at one fell swoop.
</td></tr>

<tr><td>simrelat</td><td>
In this example, the relative homology of a pair of simplicial complexes 
is computed in two ways: either with the use of the programs
<em>simchain</em> and <em>homchain</em> in a sequence,
or with the program <em>homsimpl</em> which does the same computations
as both other programs.
</td></tr>

<tr><td>slicing</td><td>
This is an example of a big cube with some small cubes removed from it 
in such a way that the resulting set is homotopically equivalent to the 
wadge sum of 2 circles, 2 spheres and one torus of genus 2. This example 
was created with a program by T. Grudskaya, which I got from G. Watson.
If this set is sliced along one of the coordinate axes into several pieces 
which overlap for the width of one or more cubes, then these pieces 
can be reduced separately, provided the overlapping parts are preserved. 
After gluing the reduced pieces together, one can compute the homology of 
this set and the result should be the same as for the entire set, but the 
computations should be faster.
This example illustrates how to use the program <em>cubslice</em>
to cut a large cubical set into slices, then how to use the program
<em>homcubes</em> to do the full-dimensional geometric cubical reduction
only (without computing homology), and then how to use the program
<em>psetglue</em> to join cubical sets together (compute their union).
</td></tr>

<tr><td>torus</td><td>
In this example the homology module of the torus is computed.
A chain complex of the torus is stored in a file and its homology 
module is computed by the program <em>homchain</em>.
An extra file illustrates some details of the text data format
for defining chain complexes.
</td></tr>

<tr><td>vanderpl</td><td>
This is an example of a cubical map generated for the Van der Pol
equations embedded in <b>R</b><sup>3</sup>.
An isolating neighbourhood of an attracting
trajectory was chosen here and a map corresponding to a discretization
of the dynamical system was generated. Each cube is mapped into
a rectangular set in <b>R</b><sup>3</sup> (a prism)
contained in this neighbourhood.
This example shows two methods of computing the homomorphism
induced in homology by a cubical map: either with the programs
<em>chmap</em>, <em>chvchmap</em>, and <em>homchain</em>
(the program <em>chkperf</em>
is also used to verify the assumptions), or with <em>homcubes</em>
directly (the program <em>chkmvmap</em> is used to check the assumptions).
Note the usage of the command-line option <em>-i</em>.
</td></tr>

<tr><td>wind3</td><td>
This is a very simple example of a chain map which maps the circle 
onto itself with triple winding up.
It shows how to define chain complexes and a chain map between them,
and also how to compute the homomorphism induced in homology by such a map.
</td></tr>

<tr><td>wrapped</td><td>
This example illustrates the idea of space wrapping (a.k.a. periodic
boundary conditions), and explains how to use the program
<em>homcubes</em> to compute homology of cubical sets
with identified edges.
</td></tr>
