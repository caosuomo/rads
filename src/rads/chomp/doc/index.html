<p>These few HTML pages included in the CHomP Software source code
package have been extracted from the
<a href="http://chomp.rutgers.edu/">CHomP website</a>.
Please, consult that website
for the most up-to-date version of these web pages, and also
for additional information.</p>

<p>The software provided here is related to algorithmic
homology computation of cubical sets and maps, simplicial complexes,
and chain complexes. In addition to that, some software useful
in related fields is also supplied here, including software for
manipulating cubical sets and maps.</p>

<p>The software package consists of <A HREF="programs.html">programs</A>
and a C++ library, both available at the CHomP website for download
with their source code under the terms of the
<A HREF="license.html">GNU&nbsp;General&nbsp;Public&nbsp;License</A>
(note that this license applies also to the library!).</p>

<p>This package also includes a set of <a href="examples.html">examples</a>
which illustrate some aspects of the data formats
that are used by the programs, and also how to use the programs
themselves.</p>

<p>A nice interactive program called <a href="chooser.html">CHomP
Software Chooser</a> is a portable Python script
which allows one to compose the command line
of most CHomP programs in an easy way just by filling out a form.
It shows descriptions of all the programs
and their command line arguments.</p>

<P>The main program in the package is <EM>homcubes</EM> which is an advanced
program for the computation of homology of cubical sets, including relative
homology, and also for the computation of homomorphisms induced in homology
by combinatorial cubical multivalued maps.
This program follows an algorithm
described in the paper <EM>Graph approach to the computation
of the homology of continuous maps</EM> by K. Mischaikow, M. Mrozek,
and P. Pilarczyk.</P>

<P>The most important of the other programs contained in this package
are <EM>homchain</EM> - a program for the homology computation
of finitely generated free chain complexes (with the support for coefficients
in <EM>Z</EM> or <EM>Z<SUB>p</SUB></EM>),
and <EM>homsimpl</EM> - a program for the homology computation
of finite simplicial complexes.
In addition to these programs, the package contains
many other (hopefully useful) <A HREF="programs.html">programs</A>.</p>

<p>The package also contains a C++ library interface
to the homology computation routines, which one can use in one's own software.
The CHomP library allows a C++ programmer to access the data structures
and homology computation procedures directly from their own programs,
without the need to write data to files and then run homology programs
which would read them in turn. This makes it easy to write fast software
that utilizes homology computation algorithms.</p>

<p>A new version of the homology computation algorithms for full cubical sets
based on bitmaps and algebraic coreductions is implemented in the
program <em>chomp</em> (contained in the basic version of the
Homology Package). This program is capable of reading several
formats of input files, including the text formats supported by
<em>homcubes</em>, and a binary bitmap format as well. It contains
multiple engines for the homology computation, both the new algorithms
and the ones available in <em>homcubes</em> and <em>chom</em>.</p>
